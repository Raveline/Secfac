# Secfac (prototype)

## What is it ?

### The idea 

SecFac is a game where you have to manage an underground secure facility (hence
the name).  This facility belongs to an entity we will ominously call The
Government (do not be fooled by this name, it's sure to be an Illuminati
smoke-screen). The facility will store dangerous artefacts and supernatural,
dangerous objects. Your goal is to make sure research can be made on those
items without the world being destroyed (or worse, the project going bankrupt).

### Inspiration 

The idea for this game come from the wonderful SPC Foundation website. But
there are various other sources : X-Files, Supernatural, various conspiracy
theories and their "gamification" in diverse genres (take for instance the
Delta Green book for Call of Cthulhu), hermetic tradition, the lovecraftian
universe, artefacts from various religions, etc.

### Gameplay 

The game is in roguelike-ascii style, with a side-view of the facility. You
could see it as a mix of Dwarf Fortress (visual interface, absence of direct
control), Dungeon Keeper (base control gameplay) and 

## Dependencies, etc.

Secfac is coded using only Python (2.7) and the libtcod library.
It should run on any python-compatible OS.

## Prototype ?

Well to be frank I don't think Python is a good choice for this kind of
projects. However, I currently don't have the time to pick something better. If
I had all the time of the world (and the skills I'd like !) I would most
certainly do it in Haskell. However, since I don't want to code a roguelike
utility library in Haskell and that the one existing (Lambdahack) does not
really suit my needs, I decided to only do a "prototype", and to use python not
to lose to many hours coding it.
